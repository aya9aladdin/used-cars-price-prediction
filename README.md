# used-cars-price-prediction
Car prices in Egypt have been in a chaotic situation, especially in the used cars market. In this project, we will try to analyze the data of nearly a 3OK 
cars listed on Hatla2ee.com (one of Egypt's most significant used cars websites) for sale. After developing the analytics dashboard I will develop
a machine-learning model that can predict used car prices according to the car brand, model, mileage, etc.

## Data source:

I used `beatifulSoup` library to scrap the whole used car data on hatla2ee.com.
